#### Example of input initialization

```python
import pandas as pd

from log_distance_measures.config import EventLogIDs

# Set event log column ID mapping
event_log_ids = EventLogIDs(  # These values are stored in DEFAULT_CSV_IDS
    case="case_id",
    activity="Activity",
    start_time="start_time",
    end_time="end_time"
)
# Read and transform time attributes
event_log = pd.read_csv("/path/to/event_log.csv")
event_log[event_log_ids.start_time] = pd.to_datetime(event_log[event_log_ids.start_time], utc=True)
event_log[event_log_ids.end_time] = pd.to_datetime(event_log[event_log_ids.end_time], utc=True)
```

## Control-flow Log Distance (CFLD)

Distance measure between two event logs with the same number of traces (_L1_ and _L2_) comparing the control-flow dimension (see "Camargo
M, Dumas M, Gonz√°lez-Rojas O. 2021. Discovering generative models from event logs: data-driven simulation vs deep learning. PeerJ Computer
Science 7:e577 https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.577" for a detailed description of a similarity version of this measure).

1. Transform each process trace of _L1_ and _L2_ to their corresponding activity sequence.
2. Compute the Damerau-Levenshtein distance between each trace _i_ from _L1_ and each trace _j_ of _L2_, and normalize it by dividing by the
   length of the longest trace.
3. Compute the matching between the traces of both logs (such that each _i_ is matched to a different _j_, and vice versa) minimizing the
   sum of distances with linear programming.
4. Compute the CFLD as the average of the normalized distance values.

### Example of use

```python
from log_distance_measures.config import DEFAULT_CSV_IDS
from log_distance_measures.control_flow_log_distance import control_flow_log_distance

# Call passing the event logs, and its column ID mappings
distance = control_flow_log_distance(
    original_log, DEFAULT_CSV_IDS,  # First event log and its column id mappings
    simulated_log, DEFAULT_CSV_IDS,  # Second event log and its column id mappings
)
```

&nbsp;

## N-Gram Distribution Distance

Distance measure between two event logs computing the difference in the frequencies of the n-grams observed in the event logs (
being the n-grams of an event log all the groups of `n` consecutive elements observed in it).

1. Given a size `n`, get all sequences of `n` activities (n-gram) observed in each event log (adding artificial activities to the start and
   end of each trace to consider these as well, e.g., `0 - 0 - A` for a trace starting with `A` and an `n = 3`).
2. Compute the number of times that each n-gram is observed in each event log (its frequency).
3. Compute the sum of absolute differences between the frequencies of all computed n-grams (e.g. the frequency of `A - B - C` in the first
   event log w.r.t. its frequency in the second event log).

### Example of use

```python
from log_distance_measures.config import DEFAULT_CSV_IDS
from log_distance_measures.n_gram_distribution import n_gram_distribution_distance

# Call passing the event logs, and its column ID mappings
distance = n_gram_distribution_distance(
    original_log, DEFAULT_CSV_IDS,  # First event log and its column id mappings
    simulated_log, DEFAULT_CSV_IDS,  # Second event log and its column id mappings
    n=3  # trigrams
)
```

&nbsp;

## Absolute Event Distribution Distance

Distance measure computing how different the histograms of the timestamps of two event logs are, discretizing the timestamps by absolute
hour.

1. Take all the start timestamps, the end timestamps, or both.
2. Discretize the timestamps by absolute hour (those timestamps between `02/05/2022 10:00:00` and `02/05/2022 10:59:59` go to the same
   bin).
3. Compare the discretized histograms of the two event logs with the Wasserstein Distance (a.k.a. EMD).

### Example of use

```python
from log_distance_measures.absolute_event_distribution import absolute_event_distribution_distance
from log_distance_measures.config import AbsoluteTimestampType, DEFAULT_CSV_IDS, discretize_to_hour

# Call passing the event logs, its column ID mappings, timestamp type, and discretize function
distance = absolute_event_distribution_distance(
    original_log, DEFAULT_CSV_IDS,  # First event log and its column id mappings
    simulated_log, DEFAULT_CSV_IDS,  # Second event log and its column id mappings
    discretize_type=AbsoluteTimestampType.BOTH,  # Type of timestamp distribution (consider start times and/or end times)
    discretize_event=discretize_to_hour  # Function to discretize the absolute seconds of each timestamp (default by hour)
)
```

This EMD measure can be also used to compare the distribution of the start timestamps (with `AbsoluteHourEmdType.START`), or the end
timestamps (with `AbsoluteHourEmdType.END`), instead of both of them.

Furthermore, the binning is performed to hour by default, but it can be customized passing another function discretize the total amount of
seconds to its bin.

```python
import math

from log_distance_measures.absolute_event_distribution import absolute_event_distribution_distance
from log_distance_measures.config import AbsoluteTimestampType, DEFAULT_CSV_IDS, discretize_to_day

# EMD of the (END) timestamps distribution where each bin represents a day
distance = absolute_event_distribution_distance(
    original_log, DEFAULT_CSV_IDS,
    simulated_log, DEFAULT_CSV_IDS,
    discretize_type=AbsoluteTimestampType.END,
    discretize_event=discretize_to_day
)

# EMD of the timestamps distribution where each bin represents a week
distance = absolute_event_distribution_distance(
    original_log, DEFAULT_CSV_IDS,
    simulated_log, DEFAULT_CSV_IDS,
    discretize_event=lambda seconds: math.floor(seconds / 3600 / 24 / 7)
)
```

&nbsp;

## Case Arrival Distribution Distance

Distance measure computing how different the discretized histograms of the arrival events of two event logs are.

1. Compute the arrival timestamp for each process case (its first start time).
2. Discretize the timestamps by absolute hour (those timestamps between `02/05/2022 10:00:00` and `02/05/2022 10:59:59` go to the same
   bin).
3. Compare the discretized histograms of the two event logs with the Wasserstein Distance (a.k.a. EMD).

### Example of use

```python
from log_distance_measures.case_arrival_distribution import case_arrival_distribution_distance
from log_distance_measures.config import DEFAULT_CSV_IDS, discretize_to_hour

distance = case_arrival_distribution_distance(
    original_log, DEFAULT_CSV_IDS,  # First event log and its column id mappings
    simulated_log, DEFAULT_CSV_IDS,  # Second event log and its column id mappings
    discretize_event=discretize_to_hour  # Function to discretize each timestamp (default by hour)
)
```

&nbsp;

## Circadian Event Distribution Distance

Distance measure computing how different the histograms of the timestamps of two event logs are, comparing all the instants recorded in the
same weekday together, and discretizing them to the hour in the day.

1. Take all the start timestamps, the end timestamps, or both.
2. Group the timestamps by their weekday (e.g. all the timestamps recorded on Monday of one log are going to be compared with the timestamps
   recorded on Monday of the other event log).
3. Discretize the timestamps to their hour (those timestamps between '10:00:00' and '10:59:59' go to the same bin).
4. Compare the histograms of the two event logs for each weekday (with the Wasserstein Distance, a.k.a. EMD), and compute the average.

_Extra 1_: If there are no recorded timestamps for one of the weekdays in both logs, no distance is measured for that day.
_Extra 2_: If there are no recorded timestamps for one of the weekdays in one of the logs, the distance for that day is set to 23 (the
maximum distance for two histograms with values from 0 to 23)

### Example of use

```python
from log_distance_measures.circadian_event_distribution import circadian_event_distribution_distance
from log_distance_measures.config import AbsoluteTimestampType, DEFAULT_CSV_IDS

distance = circadian_event_distribution_distance(
    original_log, DEFAULT_CSV_IDS,  # First event log and its column id mappings
    simulated_log, DEFAULT_CSV_IDS,  # Second event log and its column id mappings
    discretize_type=AbsoluteTimestampType.BOTH  # Consider both start/end timestamps of each activity instance
)
```

Similarly than with the Absolute Event Distribution Distance, the Circadian Event Distribution Distance can be also used to compare the
distribution of the start timestamps (with `AbsoluteHourEmdType.START`), or the end timestamps (with `AbsoluteHourEmdType.END`), instead of
both of them.

&nbsp;

## Relative Event Distribution Distance

Distance measure computing how different the histograms of the relative (w.r.t. the start of each case) timestamps of two event logs are,
discretizing the timestamps by absolute hour.

1. Take all the start timestamps, the end timestamps, or both.
2. Make them relative w.r.t. the start of their process case (e.g. the first timestamp in a case is 0, the second one is the time itnerval
   from the first one).
3. Discretize the durations by hour (e.g. those durations between `0` and `3599` go to the same bin).
4. Compare the discretized histograms of the two event logs with the Wasserstein Distance (a.k.a. EMD).

### Example of use

```python
from log_distance_measures.config import AbsoluteTimestampType, DEFAULT_CSV_IDS, discretize_to_hour
from log_distance_measures.relative_event_distribution import relative_event_distribution_distance

# Call passing the event logs, its column ID mappings, timestamp type, and discretize function
distance = relative_event_distribution_distance(
    original_log, DEFAULT_CSV_IDS,  # First event log and its column id mappings
    simulated_log, DEFAULT_CSV_IDS,  # Second event log and its column id mappings
    discretize_type=AbsoluteTimestampType.BOTH,  # Type of timestamp distribution (consider start times and/or end times)
    discretize_event=discretize_to_hour  # Function to discretize the absolute seconds of each timestamp (default by hour)
)
```

Similarly than with the Absolute Event Distribution Distance, the Relative Event Distribution Distance can be also used to compare the
distribution of the start timestamps (with `AbsoluteHourEmdType.START`), or the end timestamps (with `AbsoluteHourEmdType.END`), instead of
both of them.

## Work in Progress Distance

Distance measure computing how different the histograms of the number of active cases (computing the average active cases per window) of two
event logs are.

1. Build a timeline with a bin for each hour since the beginning to the end of both logs.
2. Compute, for each bin, the average number of active cases (e.g. 4 and a half active cases in the window from `01/01/2023 10:00:00` to
   `01/01/2023 10:59:59`).
3. Compare the histograms of the two event logs with the Wasserstein Distance (a.k.a. EMD).

### Example of use

```python
import pandas as pd

from log_distance_measures.config import DEFAULT_CSV_IDS
from log_distance_measures.active_cases_over_time import work_in_progress_distance

# Call passing the event logs, its column ID mappings, timestamp type, and discretize function
work_in_progress_distance(
    original_log, DEFAULT_CSV_IDS,  # First event log and its column id mappings
    simulated_log, DEFAULT_CSV_IDS,  # Second event log and its column id mappings
    window_size=pd.Timedelta(hours=1)  # Bins of 1 hour
)
```

&nbsp;

## Cycle Time Distribution Distance

Distance measure computing how different the cycle time discretized histograms of two event logs are.

1. Compute the cycle time of each process instance.
2. Group the cycle times in bins by a given bin size (time gap).
3. Compare the discretized histograms of the two event logs with the Wasserstein Distance (a.k.a. EMD).

### Example of use

```python
import pandas as pd

from log_distance_measures.config import DEFAULT_CSV_IDS
from log_distance_measures.cycle_time_distribution import cycle_time_distribution_distance

distance = cycle_time_distribution_distance(
    original_log, DEFAULT_CSV_IDS,  # First event log and its column id mappings
    simulated_log, DEFAULT_CSV_IDS,  # Second event log and its column id mappings
    bin_size=pd.Timedelta(hours=1)  # Bins of 1 hour
)
```
